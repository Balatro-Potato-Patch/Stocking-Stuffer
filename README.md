# Welcome to Stocking Stuffer!
## A small Balatro modjam mod about opening presents

Here's a short refresher of how you will participate in this mod:

1. Make a fork of this repo. You will not be able to push edits otherwise

2. You are to make 1 Wrapped Present and 5 Presents
  - The player can hold onto an infinite number of Presents
  - Presents have the unique property of triggering twice, once before and once after Joker calculations
  - Presents can also optionally be consumables if you so choose
  - It is recommended you choose between scoring or consumable, not using both unless you know exactly what you are doing
  - Presents can also have negative effects if you so choose, but this is not required
  - A template file is provided for you to derive from

3. You are not allowed to change `main.lua` or `present_utils.toml`. If you require something to be changed, please contact an event organizer.
  - Pull requests with unauthorized changes to these files will be rejected

4. Once you are finished making your additions, create a Pull Request to the original repo!
  - Please refer to the rules in the Discord regarding PR conventions
  - You are not allowed to view Pull Requests from other participants. No peeking at your Christmas presents!

5. You have until December 15th to complete these tasks

### Have a happy holiday!
